## Experience Gained

During the development of the Employee-MS project, I gained valuable experience in web development and project management:
- Technology Development: Improved skills in both front-end (ReactJS) and back-end (Node.js, Express) development.
- API Development: Gained experience in building API with RESTful APIs.
- Data Management: Learned how the data was transported from client to server, stored in database, and back.
- Authentication: Implemented authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), reset token when the password is forgotten, and refresh token. 
- Input Validation: Validated input data on both client and server side.
- Deployment: Deploying applications on Vercel, Render, and MongoDB Atlas platforms.
- Project Management: Use git to manage & save source code, and roll back when errors occur.
- Self-Learning: The importance of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest technologies.
